<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hitachi Data Systems - UCP</strong> (Bellevue, WA)</p>
<p>Senior Technical Architect, 2011 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote automation framework for deployment of management software stack; a side project that turned into a key component of the product. Decreased onsite software deployment time by 95%. Technologies used: PowerShell, PowerCLI, Perl, XML.</li>
<li>Created a suite of tools to detect hardware misconfigurations/failures and ready systems for shipping. These tools immediately reduced the number of support issues seen at time of onsite deployment. Tools directly interfaced with Ethernet and FC switches, blade servers, and SAN storage.</li>
<li>Reverse engineered a third party software product and produced a POC API to prevent a core feature from being dropped. Feature ended up releasing on time and native API was later released. Technologies used: Flask, Fiddler, Tamper Data, Wireshark, XML-RPC.</li>
<li>Developed web frontend to allow shared scheduling of hardware environments. Created an automatic reclaim feature that found more than 30% of gear was unused. Helped automation team integrate with webapp and schedule automatic runs on idle hardware. Technologies used: PHP, Bootstrap, Jquery, MySQL, RackTables.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented a product feature to support unattended baremetal installation of Windows, Linux, and ESXi. Technologies used: iPXE, WDS, Auto Deploy, Syslinux, C#.</li>

<li><p><strong>Hitachi Data Systems - HCP</strong> (Waltham, MA)</p>
<p>Solutions Architect, 2008 - 2011</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolved high priority customer data outage by writing code to run in parallel across cluster. Initial estimate to recover data relying on product feature was reduced from two weeks down to a single day. Technologies used: Bash, Postgres.</li>
<li>Developed tools for end-to-end automated deployment of product through PXE infrastructure. Tools were added to automation framework and allowed for continuous testing against latest software builds. Technologies used: Python, Django, Postgres, PXE.</li>
<li>Discovered and reproduced hard to find Java memory leak in customer environment that was causing slowdowns and outages. Hotfix was created and later integrated into product. Technologies used: Exchange 2010, VisualVM, standard Linux utilities.</li>
