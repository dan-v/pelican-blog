<ul>
<li>Wrote automation framework for deployment of management software stack. Decreased onsite software deployment time by 95%. Technologies used: PowerShell, VMware vSphere, PowerCLI, XML.</li>
<li>Created a suite of tools for use at distribution center that detects hardware misconfiguration/failures and configures the system for shipping. These tools directly interface with network switches, fibre channel switches, servers, and storage. Technologies used: PowerShell, CentOS, SSH, Regex.</li>
<li>Reverse engineered a third party software product and produced POC API to prevent blocked feature from being dropped. Feature ended up releasing on time and native API was later released. Technologies used: Fiddler, Tamper Data, Wireshark, XML-RPC.</li>
<li>Developed web frontend to allow scheduling usage of hardware environments internally. An automatic reclaim feature was added that found more than 30% of the gear was not being used. Helped automation team hook into this application to schedule automatic runs on idle hardware. Technologies used: PHP, Jquery, MySQL, RackTables.</li>
