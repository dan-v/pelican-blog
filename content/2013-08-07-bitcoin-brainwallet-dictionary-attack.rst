For those who aren't familiar with a brainwallet, it is the concept of storing your bitcoins in a wallet that was created with a passphrase. It is generally a bad idea to use brainwallets especially with short passphrases as it is very easy to brute force attack. An example of an online brainwallet generator is brainwallet.org_.

.. _brainwallet.org: http://brainwallet.org/

I wanted to create a simple program that would take a dictionary word, convert it into a bitcoin address, and then check to see if any bitcoin transactions had ever taken place with this address. I was curious to see how many insecure brainwallets existed. 

I was able to borrow the bitcoin address generation code_ and had initially planned to point it at blockexplorer.com_ but then realized that this would probably end up flooding the site with traffic. It also appeared to be possible to get address information from a local bitcoin server (using JSON-RPC), but it was fairly slow. I settled on to setting up a blockexplorer of my own called Abe_. After getting it up and running, it took over a week to insert all transactions into the database from the blockchain.

It was then just a matter of finding a simple dictionary_ file and writing a script to:

- Convert a word into public/private bitcoin addresses
- Check with local Abe server using HTTP request to see if any bitcoins had ever been received by this public address. 
- Save to file any addresses that have had transactions take place.

You can find the script on Github_.

Here are the brainwallets I found with this particular dictionary. Note: apparently this dictionary has duplicate words, so a little cleanup was required.
